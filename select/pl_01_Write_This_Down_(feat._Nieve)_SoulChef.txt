Don't want to write this down
I want say it
while its like this now
so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it
while its like this now
so let me have the mic
I'm getting older
I'm no longer the young pro
So ain't no little kid going to
tell me I'm done for
And you ain't even worth it
to rhyme to
Just thought I'd go
and leave a little note
to remind you
In case you want to
Stir the pot up
Cause a little drama
You don't really want to battle
I'll say things
you never thought of
And have never seen
You caught a line
and became a fiend
My dope rhyme like amphetamine
You had a dream
The type to make you
think you fall through
Who you think you are
you ain't too big to sock two
A kick one
I grab the mic and I spit son
Try to share the soul laying low
in my system
And say whatever it just don't
Matter anymore
I know my future is destined
To carry on
There's no baggage
thats heavy on
My shoulders are very strong.
you know
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me have the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me have the mic
(uh)
It's just the same old motif
The heart never safe
pretty girls a cold thief
She got away
The way
she move make you want to stay
Its kind of smooth
how she stalk her prey
I walk away
Don't blame me
if you see me look back though
She fit me to a Texas T
Baby was black gold
And from my rap flow
I thought I had her
but I guess it didn't matter
She didn't think it was
that dope
Leave the girl
with the woe is me
Just another slide show
in my poetry
Picture me rollin
in a five hundred
Buying roses in the dozen
For the lady I want
Won't that be something
But I'm worried it will never be
Too many games be played love
We use it in a phrase
like a spelling bee
Putting her spell on me
Hypnotized
Was the devil in disguise
She decided the hell with me
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me have the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me grab the mic
Don't want to write this down
I want say it while
its like this now
so let me have the mic
