[00:04.93] Yeah, Nieve
[00:08.75] Goon Trax
[00:10.93] A SoulChef production
[00:12.86] Got me like
[00:18.36] 
[00:13.50] Don't want to write this down
[00:14.99] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me grab the mic
[00:18.95] Don't want to write this down
[00:20.28] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me have the mic
[00:52.78] 
[00:23.29] I'm getting older, I'm no longer the young pro
[00:25.65] So ain't no little kid going to tell me I'm done for
[00:27.94] And you ain't even worth it to rhyme to
[00:30.14] Just thought I'd go and leave a little note to remind you
[00:32.64] In case you want to
[00:42.14] 
[00:33.74] Stir the pot up
[00:34.68] 'Cause a little drama
[00:35.74] You don't really want to battle
[00:37.01] I'll say things you never thought of
[00:38.47] And have never seen
[00:39.62] You caught a line and became a fiend
[00:41.12] My dope rhyme like amphetamine
[00:56.12] 
[00:43.24] You had a dream
[00:44.26] The type to make you think you fall through
[00:46.17] Who you think you are you ain't too big to sock two
[00:48.69] A kick one
[00:50.08] I grab the mic and I spit son
[00:51.32] Try to share the soul laying low in my system
[00:54.72] And say whatever, it just don't
[00:56.68] Matter anymore, I know my future is destined
[00:59.18] To carry on
[00:59.90] There's no baggage that's heavy on
[01:02.00] My shoulders are very strong, you know
[01:21.00] 
[01:04.76] Don't want to write this down
[01:06.73] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me grab the mic
[01:10.36] Don't want to write this down
[01:11.72] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me have the mic
[01:44.22] 
[01:15.26] Don't want to write this down
[01:16.95] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me grab the mic
[01:20.39] Don't want to write this down
[01:22.07] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me have the mic
[01:54.57] 
[01:25.36] (Uh)
[01:26.17] It's just the same old motif
[01:27.36] The heart never safe pretty girls a cold thief
[01:30.02] She got away
[01:30.81] The way she move make you want to stay
[01:32.85] It's kind of smooth how she stalk her prey
[01:53.85] 
[01:35.04] I walk away
[01:35.88] Don't blame me if you see me look back though
[01:37.85] She fit me to a Texas T
[01:39.39] Baby was black gold
[01:40.82] And from my rap flow
[01:42.08] I thought I had her, but I guess it didn't matter
[01:44.03] She didn't think it was that dope
[02:00.53] 
[01:45.98] Leave the girl with the woe is me
[01:48.05] Just another slide show in my poetry
[01:50.53] Picture me rollin' in a five hundred
[01:52.67] Buying roses in the dozen for the lady I want
[01:55.07] Won't that be something?
[02:07.07] 
[01:55.65] But I worry it will never be
[01:57.26] Too many games be played love
[01:59.16] We use it in a phrase like a spelling bee
[02:01.35] Putting a spell on me, hypnotized
[02:03.66] Was the devil in disguise, she decided to hell with me, yeah
[02:33.66] 
[02:07.12] Don't want to write this down
[02:08.69] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me grab the mic
[02:12.13] Don't want to write this down
[02:13.85] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me have the mic
[02:46.35] 
[02:17.34] Don't want to write this down
[02:18.68] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me grab the mic
[02:22.43] Don't want to write this down
[02:24.12] I want to say it while it's like this now, so let me have the mic, yeah
